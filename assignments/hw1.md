# CSV-Based Algorithmic Trading Backtester

Due: Sun Sep 21, 2025

## Overview

Design and implement a modular Python backtester that reads pre-generated market data from a CSV file, applies trading strategies, executes simulated orders, and produces a performance report. You will practice mutable versus immutable types, object-oriented design with abstract classes and inheritance, container management using lists and dictionaries, and robust exception handling.

## Learning Objectives

- Parse CSV data into immutable dataclass instances
- Distinguish and use mutable classes for order management
- Build an abstract `Strategy` interface with concrete subclasses
- Manage time-series data and portfolio state using lists and dictionaries
- Define custom exceptions and handle errors without stopping the backtest
- Generate a Markdown report summarizing key performance metrics

## Task Specifications

### 1. Data Ingestion & Immutable Types

Read `market_data.csv` (columns: `timestamp`, `symbol`, `price`) using the built-in `csv` module.

Define a frozen dataclass `MarketDataPoint` with attributes `timestamp` (datetime), `symbol` (str), and `price` (float).

Parse each row into a `MarketDataPoint` and collect them in a list.

### 2. Mutable Order Management

Implement an `Order` class with mutable attributes: `symbol`, `quantity`, `price`, and `status`.

Demonstrate in a unit test that you can update `Order.status` but not `MarketDataPoint.price`.

### 3. Object-Oriented Design

Create an abstract base class:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Strategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def generate_signals(self, tick: MarketDataPoint) -> list:
        pass
```

Provide two concrete strategies (e.g., moving average crossover, momentum) that inherit from `Strategy`.

Encapsulate any internal buffers or indicator values as private attributes (e.g., `self._prices`, `self._window`).

### 4. Containers for Data & Signals

Buffer incoming `MarketDataPoint` instances in a list.

Store open positions in a dictionary keyed by symbol: `{'AAPL': {'quantity': 0, 'avg_price': 0.0}}`.

Collect signals as a list of tuples `(action, symbol, qty, price)` before converting them to `Order` objects.

### 5. Exception Handling

Define custom exceptions:

```python
class OrderError(Exception): pass
class ExecutionError(Exception): pass
```

Raise `OrderError` for invalid orders (e.g., zero or negative quantity).

In the execution engine, simulate occasional failures and raise `ExecutionError`; catch and log these errors to continue processing.

### 6. Execution Engine

Iterate through the list of `MarketDataPoint` objects in timestamp order.

For each tick:

- Invoke each strategy to generate signals
- Instantiate and validate `Order` objects
- Execute orders by updating the portfolio dictionary

Wrap order creation and execution in `try/except` blocks for resilience.

### 7. Performance Reporting

After processing all ticks, compute:

- Total return
- Series of periodic returns
- Sharpe ratio
- Maximum drawdown

Generate a `performance.md` report with:

- Tables summarizing metrics
- An equity-curve plot (e.g., ASCII art or embedded chart link)
- A short narrative interpretation of results

## Deliverables

Upload all these files into a GitHub repo (username: `sdonadio`):

- `data_loader.py` — CSV reading and `MarketDataPoint` creation
- `models.py` — dataclasses, `Order`, exceptions
- `strategies.py` — abstract `Strategy` and concrete implementations
- `engine.py` — backtesting logic and order execution
- `reporting.py` — performance computation and Markdown report generation
- `main.py` — orchestrating data loading, strategy execution, and reporting (or use a Python notebook)
- Unit tests (or use a Python notebook)
- `performance.ipynb` — containing metrics, tables, plots, and narrative
- `README.md` — setup instructions and module descriptions
